# HomeMath
HomeMath is a lightweight iOS mortgage calculator built with SwiftUI.  
It estimates monthly mortgage payments and visualizes principal, interest, and related costs using standard amortization formulas.

The app runs fully offline and does not collect user data. All results are estimates only.
